1.Write a query to fetch and display the number of students enrolled for modules on a specific date grouped by start date and display start date and 
total number of students.

2.Write a query to fetch and displaythe number of students enrolled for modules where facultyid is ‘F001’ grouped by start date and display
 start date and total number of students.

3.Write a query to fetch and displaythe number of students enrolled for modules where facultyid is ‘F001’ grouped by module start date and 
   display module start date and total number of students where the total number of students> 2.

4.Write a query to fetch and displayall the modules in ascending order of module duration.

5.Write aquery to fetch and displaythe student’sname, their module enrolled (module name and module id). Order them according to their name.

6.Write a query to fetch and display faculty_id and batch_id which will fetchall the combinations of facultyIDs and batch IDs.

7.Write a query to fetch and displaythe records of all the details from Student_Status and batch_info, wherever batch_id is common in both the tables.

8.Write a query to fetch and display the student IDs of the students tagged to facultyand all the faculty IDs irrespective of whether there are 
any students tagged to them or not. Hint: Use Student_status and FacultyDetails tables and Right Outer Join

9.Write a query to fetch and display the studentIDs of the students tagged to faculties and all the faculty IDs irrespective of whether there are any students tagged to them or not. 
Hint: Use Student_status and FacultyDetails tables and LeftOuter Join

10.Write a query to fetch and displaythe student IDs ofall the students and faculty IDs of all faculties irrespective of whetherthese is any association 
between students and faculty Ids and vice versa.Hint: Use Student_status and FacultyDetails tables and FullOuter Jointhough 
full outer join is not supported by MYSQL we have to find out a way to implement that.
